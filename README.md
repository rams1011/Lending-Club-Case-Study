## General Information
- Lending Club is consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. 
- Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
- The business problem we are trying to solve with this project is to identify risky loan applications based on the factors that contibuted to loans being 
Charged off from historical loan data
- Data set used for analysis [loan.csv](https://github.com/rams1011/Lending-Club-Case-Study/blob/main/loan.csv)

## Conclusions
- Any loan with interest rate above 18% has more chances of defaulting
- Applicants with grades F,G has more chances of defaulting
- Applicants with loan purpose small business and interest rate greater than 15% has more chances of defaulting
- Applicants with Annual income <= 90k and Interest >= 17% has more chances of defaulting
